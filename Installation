If amazon-linux-extras and epel-release are both missing, you are NOT on Amazon Linux 2 — you are almost certainly on Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023).
Amazon Linux 2023 does NOT support amazon-linux-extras or epel-release.
Packages are installed only through dnf and the new modular repositories.

Below are the correct installation steps for both systems so you can pick the one that matches your machine.

Check Your OS Version First:
---------------------------
#cat /etc/os-release
If Amazon Linux 2023:
NAME="Amazon Linux"
VERSION="2023"

AL2023 does not ship Ansible in its repos. The recommended way is to install via pip.
Install Python & pip:
#sudo dnf install -y python3 python3-pip
Install Ansible via pip
#sudo pip3 install ansible
Verify version
#ansible --version
ansible [core 2.15.3]
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansibleUser -> provide instructions to 
  ansible collection location = /root/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.9.24 (main, Oct 20 2025, 00:00:00) [GCC 11.5.0 20240719 (Red Hat 11.5.0-5)] (/usr/bin/python3.9)
  jinja version = 3.1.4
  libyaml = True

PasswordLess Authentication:
---------------------------
User -> Provide instructions to ansible that was installed in controlnode or master node(provide instructions through yaml or adhoc commands)
Instructions like to install nginx on managed nodes.
When ansi  ble tries to execute the instructions but all managed nodes getting blocked(Authentication error/issue).
2ways to provide authentication(password, ssh keys(public&private keys)).

Prerequisite is everytime dont want to ask password...........
Setup passwordleass authentication between controlnodes and managed nodes.
what passwordless auth?
Its a mechanism where vmA tell to vmB (Anytime gettnig request from A dont ask password).
There is one time activity.
